This is a mega project.

Middlewares: Middleware is a software layer that provides common services and features to applications. In the context of web development, middleware functions are often used in frameworks to process and manipulate HTTP requests and responses. Means suppose we send a request to instagram server and then server before listening(means giving data) will check if the request author logged in or not and due to this if puts a check b/w frontend and backend and this checks the condition and then only pass the data.

we can apply as many middlewares but while applying them we should take care that we apply them in particular order because these execute in paticular order only.
